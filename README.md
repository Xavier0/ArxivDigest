**ArXiv Digest and Personalized Recommendations using Large Language Models.**

This repo aims to provide a better daily digest for newly published arXiv papers based on your own research interests and natural-language descriptions, using relevancy ratings from GPT or other compatible LLMs.

You can try it out on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AutoLLM/ArxivDigest) using your own OpenAI API key.

You can also create a daily subscription pipeline to email you the results.

## üîç What this repo does

Staying up to date on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) papers can take a considerable amount of time, with on the order of hundreds of new papers each day to filter through. There is an [official daily digest service](https://info.arxiv.org/help/subscribe.html), however large categories like [cs.AI](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent) still have 50-100 papers a day. Determining if these papers are relevant and important to you means reading through the title and abstract, which is time-consuming.

This repository offers a method to curate a daily digest, sorted by relevance, using large language models. These models are conditioned based on your personal research interests, which are described in natural language. 

### Enhanced Features:

* **Multi-API Support**: Use OpenAI, SiliconFlow, DeepSeek, or any OpenAI-compatible API
* **Bilingual Analysis**: Get paper analysis in both English and Chinese
* **Multi-Topic Search**: Search across multiple arXiv subjects simultaneously (e.g., Computer Science + Electrical Engineering)
* **Advanced Email**: SendGrid, Gmail SMTP, or custom SMTP with multi-recipient support
* **Test Mode**: Quick testing with single paper to verify configuration
* **Smart Categorization**: Automatic filtering by research areas and detailed analysis based on paper type

### Workflow:

* You modify the configuration file `config.yaml` with arXiv subjects, categories, API settings, and a natural language statement about your interests
* The code pulls abstracts for papers in those categories and ranks relevance (1-10) using your chosen LLM
* Papers get detailed bilingual analysis based on type (circuit design papers get concise summaries, algorithmic papers get detailed explanations)
* The code generates an HTML digest and optionally emails it to multiple recipients

### Testing it out with Hugging Face:

We provide a demo at [https://huggingface.co/spaces/AutoLLM/ArxivDigest](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AutoLLM/ArxivDigest). Simply enter your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and then fill in the configuration on the right. Note that we do not store your key.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
2. **Set up API key**:
   ```bash
   export CUSTOM_API_KEY='your-siliconflow-or-openai-api-key'
   # Or create a .env file with: CUSTOM_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```
3. **Run the quick start script**:
   ```bash
   python quick_start.py
   ```
   This will automatically:
   - Check your environment and dependencies
   - Test your API configuration
   - Optionally test SMTP settings
   - Run a full digest generation

### Option 2: Manual Testing

1. **Test API connection**:
   ```bash
   python test_api.py
   ```
2. **Test email configuration** (optional):
   ```bash
   python test_smtp.py
   ```
3. **Check today's papers**:
   ```bash
   python quick_check.py
   ```
4. **Generate digest**:
   ```bash
   python src/action.py --config config.yaml
   ```

## üí° Usage

### Running as a github action with custom APIs (Recommended)

The enhanced way to get started uses custom APIs like SiliconFlow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Modify `config.yaml` for your research interests
3. Set the following secrets [(under settings, Secrets and variables, repository secrets)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):
   - `CUSTOM_API_KEY` From [SiliconFlow](https://siliconflow.cn) or other provider
   - **Email settings** (choose one):
     - **SMTP**: `MAIL_CONNECTION`, `FROM_EMAIL`, `TO_EMAIL`
     - **Gmail**: `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, `FROM_EMAIL`, `TO_EMAIL`
     - **SendGrid**: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `FROM_EMAIL`, `TO_EMAIL`
4. Manually trigger the action or wait for scheduled execution

### Running as a github action using SendGrid

1. Fork the repository
2. Modify `config.yaml` and merge the changes into your main branch.
3. Set the following secrets:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` From [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` From [SendGrid](https://app.SendGrid.com/settings/api_keys)
   - `FROM_EMAIL` This value must match the email you used to create the SendGrid API Key.
   - `TO_EMAIL` (supports multiple recipients: `user1@example.com,user2@example.com`)
4. Manually trigger the action or wait until the scheduled action takes place.

### Running as a github action with SMTP credentials

An enhanced alternative using SMTP:

1. Fork the repository
2. Modify `config.yaml` and merge changes
3. Set the following secrets:
   - `CUSTOM_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **SMTP Connection String**: `MAIL_CONNECTION=smtp://user:password@server:port`
   - **Or Gmail Credentials**: `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD`
   - `FROM_EMAIL` and `TO_EMAIL`
4. Trigger manually or wait for scheduled execution

### Running from the command line

Enhanced local setup:

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and configure your API keys
3. Modify `config.yaml` for your interests
4. **Test your setup**:
   ```bash
   python test_api.py      # Test API connection
   python test_smtp.py     # Test email (optional)
   python quick_check.py   # Check today's papers
   ```
5. **Generate digest**:
   ```bash
   python src/action.py --config config.yaml
   # Or test mode: python src/action.py --config config.yaml --test-mode
   ```
6. Open `digest.html` in your browser

### Running with a user interface

To locally run the UI:

1. Install requirements including `gradio`: `pip install -r requirements.txt gradio`
2. Run `python src/app.py` and go to the local URL
3. Configure API keys in the interface or via `.env` file

> **WARNING:** Never commit your API keys! Always use environment variables or the `.env` file.
