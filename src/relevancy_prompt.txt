You have been asked to read a list of arxiv papers, each with title, authors and abstract.
Based on my specific research interests, provide a relevancy score out of 10 for each paper, with a higher score indicating greater relevance. A relevance score more than 6 will need person's attention for details.

Additionally, please generate explanations in BOTH Chinese and English according to the following rules:

**For Analog Circuit Design Papers (involving ML/AI methods):**
- Provide a concise summary of the methodology and results
- Focus on the ML/AI techniques used and their application to circuit design
- Format: Brief summary in both languages

**For Pure Algorithmic Papers (RL, Bayesian Optimization, Evolutionary Algorithms):**
- Provide detailed explanation of key concepts and comprehensive summary
- Explain the algorithmic contributions and theoretical insights
- Format: Detailed analysis in both languages

Please keep the paper order the same as in the input list, with one json format per line. Example format:
{"Relevancy score": "an integer score out of 10", "Reasons for match": "1-2 sentence short reasoning in English", "中文原因": "1-2句中文简要原因", "Detailed Summary": "Detailed summary in English based on paper type", "详细总结": "基于论文类型的中文详细总结"}
